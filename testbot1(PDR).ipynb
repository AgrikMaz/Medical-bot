However, the pres-\\nence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with a\\ngenital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid.\\nFor a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus\\nducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster-\\nile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus\\nsample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special\\nmedia and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi\\ntakes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In\\naddition, the pus may be examined under the microscope\\nto see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pus\\nmay also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. A\\nblood sample will probably be taken from the patient’s\\narm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria\\nthat causes syphilis.\\nTreatment\\nThe only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given\\neither once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouth\\nfor one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin,\\nEry-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin),\\nco-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin\\n(Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone\\n(Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or\\nofloxacin (Floxin).\\nThe ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce\\nthe swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to\\nthe ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre-\\nvent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskin\\nmay require circumcision . Pus would be removed from\\ninfected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe.\\nVery large buboes may require surgical drainage.\\nPrognosis\\nWithout treatment, chancroid may either go away\\nquickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers for\\nmany months. A complete cure is obtained with antibiotic\\ntreatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars.\\nSevere scarring of the foreskin may require circumcision.\\nUrethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urine\\ntube to the skin) may occur and requires corrective surgery.KEY TERMS\\nBubo —A tender, swollen lymph node in the groin\\nthat may follow a chancroid ulcer.\\nGroin —The region of the body that lies between\\nthe abdomen and the thighs.Prevention\\nThe best prevention for chancroid is to use a con-\\ndom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be\\nprevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con-\\ntact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with a\\ndisease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid,\\nit is important that all sexual contacts of the patient are\\nidentified and treated.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Chancroid.” In The Skin and Infection: A Color Atlas and\\nText, ed.
